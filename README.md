## Python Tutorial
This tutorial uses Jupyter notebooks to display blocks of text and code.
You can run the code blocks, edit them, and run them again.
This way, you can play around with Python
without downloading anything.

If you like it and would like to get it running on your computer
there will be a Jupyter notebook for that in the future.

For now, go [here](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ariannedee/python_tutorial/master) and start at lesson 1.
